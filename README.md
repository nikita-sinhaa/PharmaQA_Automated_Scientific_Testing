# PharmaQA Automated Scientific Testing
PharmaQA is a beginner friendly quality assurance project that simulates a real-world pharmaceutical software testing scenario.

It covers:
- Writing scientific test cases in Python
- Validating outputs with assertions
- Logging failures into JSON for dashboards
- Organising code, data, and reports

### Getting Started
1. Install Python 3.x
2. Run: `pip install pandas pytest`
3. Use `python scripts/run_all_tests.py` to execute tests
4. Use `python scripts/log_failures.py` to log failed test cases

### Folder Overview
- `data/` – Sample input data
- `test_cases/` – Python test cases using `pytest`
- `scripts/` – Automation runners and loggers
- `reports/` – Output reports/logs
- `dashboard/` – Placeholder for dashboard
