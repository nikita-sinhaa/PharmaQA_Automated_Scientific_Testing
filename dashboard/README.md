# Dashboard Placeholder

In this folder, you can create a Streamlit or Flask dashboard to:
- View failed cases from `reports/failed_cases_log.json`
- Add filters by drug, dose, or error
- Visualise response deviations using charts

This will make your QA project more interactive and visually appealing.
